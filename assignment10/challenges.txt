One challenge was identifying the correct HTML elements because the page uses deeply nested div and li tags. I resolved this by using Chrome developer tools and expanding elements incrementally to isolate the correct containers.
Another challenge was handling multiple authors for some books. This was resolved by using find_elements instead of find_element and joining the author names with semicolons.
